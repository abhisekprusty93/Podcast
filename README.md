Always inquisitive, I held the top rank in my state for 10th to 12th grade. I pursued my undergraduate education at NIT Rourkela. Following that, I gained experience as a Business Analyst, specializing in Unilever products and FMCG. My journey also includes being part of a startup and trying my hand at entrepreneurship, where I've had 2 successful years and 1.5 years of valuable lessons learned (or perhaps wasted, but with a smile). Despite briefly pursuing an MBA at Narsee Monjee, I've now accumulated a total of 11 years(June '25) of professional experience, with 6.5 years in various job roles & consulting and 3 years as an entrepreneur, and I'm currently in my 11th year( june'25) of this exciting journey.
